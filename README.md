# Particle Simulation V1

## Introduction

Welcome to **Particle Simulation V1**, a project dedicated to visualizing particle interactions using computational simulations. This simulation employs the **Lennard-Jones potential** to track particle motion within a **3D box**, illustrating how particles attract and repel each other under Newtonian mechanics. The model demonstrates how **energy conservation** governs movement and how trajectories evolve over time.

This project serves as an initial step toward scaling up simulations to analyze **complex chemical systems**. By refining accuracy and scalability, I aim to explore molecular interactions, phase transitions, and reaction dynamics. Ultimately, this work contributes to the broader field of **materials science and biochemical research**. This video is part of my personal **maker portfolio**, where I document my work in **coding, research, and robotics**. As I enhance this model, I aspire to bridge the gap between fundamental physics and real-world molecular interactions, showcasing how computational simulations offer insights into atomic and molecular-level behaviors.

## Features
